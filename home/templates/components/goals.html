                        specifically targeting 2000 students (upper primary and junior high school levels) annually in
                        the Upper East and Northern regions of Ghana. This objective aims to raise the overall
                        educational achievement of these students.</p>

                        even languages. By doing so, students will gain exposure to diverse literary content, broadening
                        their horizons and language skills.</p>
