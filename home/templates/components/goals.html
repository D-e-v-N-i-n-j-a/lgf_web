                    <p class="card-text">The primary goal of LGF is to enhance the learning outcomes of students,
                        specifically targeting 2000 students (upper primary and junior high school levels) annually in
                        the Upper East and Northern regions of Ghana. This objective aims to raise the overall
                        educational achievement of these students.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Promote Reading Diversity</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">LGF intends to expose learners to a wide variety of book genres, authors, and
                        even languages. By doing so, students will gain exposure to diverse literary content, broadening
                        their horizons and language skills.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">One of the specific objectives is to help children and students build effective
                        communication skills. Book talks provide a platform for students to discuss and articulate their
                        thoughts about books, which can significantly improve their speaking and communication
                        abilities.</p>
